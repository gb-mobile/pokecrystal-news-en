## Information 

A WIP fork of a disassembly of Pokémon Crystal's Pokemon News by Sudel-Matze.

Matze's initial repository contained a disassembly for one of the four known Pokémon News files. (Specifically 'news2.bin')

The Pokémon News was distributed via the Mobile Adapter and obtained via the in-game news machine - a feature originally only available to the Japanese version of the game.

This fork is designed to translate the news into English and to be used for the [pokecrystal-mobile-en] project.


More information about Pokémon Crystal's mobile features can be found here:

The pokecrystal directory contains some useful constants and macros sourced from [pokecrystal].

Python and RGBDS 0.5.1 are required to build the news.
