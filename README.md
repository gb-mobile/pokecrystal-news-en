## Information 

A disassembly of Pokémon Crystal's debug Pokemon News by Sudel-Matze.

The Pokémon News was distributed via the Mobile Adapter and obtained via the in-game news machine - a feature originally only available to the Japanese version of the game.

This repository can be used to build the news in both Japanese (original) and English (for the [pokecrystal-mobile-en] project).

To build a specific version, run one of these commands:

- JP Version:   `make`

- EN Version:	`make news_en`

The pokecrystal directory contains some useful constants and macros sourced from [pokecrystal].

Python and RGBDS 0.6.0 are required to build the news.
